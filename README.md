# Liquidation-Scraper
Scrapes Liquidation websites and determines the most profitable lots to purchase

TODO:

  - Ensure duplicate proxies are not being added
  - Need to check each item if it can be sold on Amazon before calculating expected sales
  - MAYBE: Every 24 hours, program runs and emails me the best lots
  - \*User Interface
  
  
\*User Interface:

  - Progress Bars based on either proxy gathering, lot gathering, or lot-amazon calculations (maybe add some cool sounds)
  - Pause, Stop, Resume buttons for each task
  - Be able to view current state (list of proxies, gathered lots, calculated lots)
  - Lot Calculation Results should be very intuitive: Easy profit numbers, best items listed first, links to manifests and amazon listings, click on lots/items to expand their info
  - Maybe use a third-party String comparison algorithm to check how similar the titles
